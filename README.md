## Overview
#### This repository contains the entirety of a machine learning project that depicts its formal document, code, process, methods, and tools used.

Titled as *Predicting the Accuracy Rate of Cancer with Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoostClassifier)* is a machine learning model/algorithm based on Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoostClassifier) on a Scikit-learn dataset (breast cancer Wisconsin) that predicts the accuracy rate of cancer to identify whether its malignant or benign. The dataset consisted a total of 569 sample of cancer instances and 30 dimensionality features. These instances were trained using the adaptive boosting algorithm to generate an accuracy level of 97.66%. 

The project was done using Python3 in Jupyter NoteBooks. For detailed breakdown of the analysis, algorithm, its method, and process, please refer to its official document (*.pdf).
